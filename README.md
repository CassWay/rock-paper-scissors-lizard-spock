# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock # 
### Practical javaScript breakdown and design of the classic and expanded ***Rock Paper Scissors Game***.

> **Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock** is an extension of the classic game of chance, Rock Paper Scissors, created by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla.
>
> *Sam Kass explains he created the expanded game because it seemed like most games of Rock Paper Scissors with people you know would end in a tie.*
>
> Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock was first mentioned in the sitcom **[The Big Bang Theory - Season 2 Episode 8, The Lizard-Spock Expansion](https://the-big-bang-theory.com/rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock/)** , the title of which references the game. It was last mentioned in **Season 5 Episode 17, The Rothman Disintegration.**
>
> As Sheldon explains, "Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors."


This project was fun and interesting. It built up the foundation layers of javaScript and introduced *switch case* ; More with *functions & arrays* ;
- I took more of a breaking-out the code approach for better visualization and reference. 


> **To be Explored:**
> - adding an *alert div to flash the WIN / Lose message* associated with it case.
